            <p>Peter's keynote speech, "Unleash the Power," covers three essential pillars for an enlightened and innovative business: Empowerment, Creativity, and Inspiration.</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> Peter emphasizes the importance of creating an environment where learning continues long after the initial teaching. He introduces exercises to uncover individual motivators, helping people understand themselves better and fostering a more efficient workforce.</li>
                <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> With his background in music and creative writing, Peter brings out the creative potential in everyone. His sessions include lateral thinking exercises and break-out groups to solve seemingly impossible problems, tailored to the specific needs of the industry.</li>
                <li><strong>Inspiration:</strong> Peter's own inspirational story, from being labeled "dumb" and "stupid" to achieving great success, serves as a powerful example. He teaches the audience how to use their own stories to inspire others, creating a workforce led to excellence rather than pushed to mediocrity.</li>
