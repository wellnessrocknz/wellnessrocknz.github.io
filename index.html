            <h1 id="winter">Winter Wellness Initiative</h1>
            <p>WINTER IS HERE ü•∂ Right on queue with this heavy welly fog! Your Wellness Team are aiming to bring a bit of light into the office this winter, through different speakers, events, and treats until Spring starts springing!!</p>
            <p>‚ù§Ô∏èüíõ We‚Äôve kicked off with yummy T2 teas and soups in the cupboards with leftover bread from Wellness lunches in the freezers ready to toast to go with ‚ù§Ô∏èüíõ</p>
            <p>Reminder too of the support we have to tap into:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Raise</strong> - We partner for EAP (Employee Assistance Programme) services with Raise. This is a great scheme which allows all of us to access confidential support from a professional counsellor, therapist, etc. Crucially, they also have a host of wellbeing and mental health resources available, incorporating maoritanga via the Te Whare Tapa Wh√† model. You can see a library of what‚Äôs available <a href="https://www.raisementalhealth.co.nz/for-employees.html">here</a>, and look at the Mental Health resources (split across 5 crucial tikanga - hinengaro, whanau, whenua, tenana, wairua) over here.</li>
                <li><strong>Spectrum Life</strong> - Spectrum Life is the U.K. equivalent of Raise, and while we understandably aren‚Äôt able to access their direct support resources, the portal still has a wealth of wellbeing (mental and physical) resources. To register for the very first time, use <a href="https://octopusenergy.spectrum.life/login?org=OctESL">this link</a>. To log in once you have registered, click <a href="https://octopusenergy.spectrum.life/login">here</a>. The Wellbeing tab here is stacked - Individual Insights via a custom survey and metrics, Fitness, Nutrition, Wellbeing, Calmness, Podcasts, the list is exhaustive!</li>
                <li><strong>Headspace</strong> - A really nifty little app (works on desktop too) that provides guided meditation and mindfulness in bite-sized pieces! Need help sleeping? Meditating? Controlling your breathing? Achieving focus? You‚Äôre covered. Use <a href="https://work.headspace.com/fieldheadspace/member-enroll">this link</a> to set up your account, then download the app on your phone!</li>
                <li><strong>Peptalk</strong> - This online service includes webinars and podcasts on a wide variety of subjects, the scope is huge - overcoming addiction, sober curiosity, personal development, career development, inclusion, neurodiversity, and more! And more talks continue to be added each month. Click <a href="https://login.getapeptalk.com/login">this link</a>, it initially won‚Äôt recognize your work email, continue to the ‚ÄúSign-Up‚Äù option instead.</li>
                <li><strong>Gym/Yoga</strong> - Free gym access just down the road, please reach out if you need to set up your account for this. Yoga at 12pm each Thursday up on Level 6.</li>
                <li><strong>Reading Nooks + Books</strong> - With the cozy nook at the back of Level 6, and comfy seating at the front of both floors, these are perfect wee spots to take yourself away from your desk for a break. Watch this space for the Sustainability Crew to share more on book swaps. üëÄ</li>
