            <h1 class="content-title">Mental Health Awareness Week at Octopus Energy</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Te Wiki o te Hauora Hinengaro (Mental Health Awareness Week) 2024 at Octopus Energy! This year's theme is about "Connecting with Nature" or "Te Taiao" in Māori, highlighting how spending time in nature can improve our mental and emotional well-being. Whether it’s taking a walk outdoors or strengthening relationships, this week encourages us all to take small steps to nurture our mental health.</p>

            <h2 class="content-subtitle">Activities in the Office</h2>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Mindfulness Monday (Rāhina Whakaāio):</strong> Start the week with guided meditation sessions to help center your mind and bring a sense of calm. We'll meet in the lounge area at 10 a.m.</li>
                <li><strong>Tūhono Thursday (Tāite Tūhono):</strong> A special day to connect with your community. Participate in our office food drive or share stories with colleagues on how they stay connected to their whānau (family) and community.</li>
                <li><strong>Feel Good Friday (Paraire Harikoa):</strong> Finish the week with a lunchtime walk in nature. Join us at 12:30 p.m. for a group walk in the nearby park to reconnect with Te Taiao (the natural environment).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="content-subtitle">Why Mental Health Matters</h2>
            <p>Mental health, or hauora hinengaro, is a vital aspect of overall well-being. Studies show that spending time in nature can reduce stress, improve mood, and enhance mental clarity. This week is an opportunity to prioritize your mental health, whether through simple activities like taking breaks, connecting with others, or reflecting on your mental well-being.</p>
            
            <p>Did you know?</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Spending just 20 minutes in nature can reduce cortisol levels (a stress hormone).</li>
                <li>In New Zealand, MHAW is celebrated annually in September as spring begins, making it an ideal time to enjoy the outdoors.</li>
                <li>Engaging with community initiatives can boost feelings of belonging and purpose, which are key for mental well-being.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="content-subtitle">How to Participate</h2>
            <p>You can join in any of the planned activities, or simply take some time to reflect on your own hauora (well-being). Whether it's practicing mindfulness, getting outdoors, or reaching out to a friend, even small actions can make a big difference.</p>

            <h2 class="content-subtitle">Mental Health Resources in New Zealand</h2>
            <p>Here are some valuable resources you can explore to support yourself and others:</p>
