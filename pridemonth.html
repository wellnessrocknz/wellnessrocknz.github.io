            <p>June is Pride Month, a time to celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community, reflect on the ongoing struggle for equal rights, and promote an inclusive society. This page is dedicated to increasing awareness and fostering an understanding of Pride Month.</p>
            
            <h2>Why is Pride Month Important?</h2>
            <p>Pride Month commemorates years of struggle for civil rights and the ongoing pursuit of equality for the LGBTQIA+ community. The celebrations and events during this month also serve as a reminder of the need for continued advocacy and support.</p>
            <p>Similarly, LGBTQIA+ stands for "lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex, asexual, and many other terms (such as non-binary and pansexual)."</p>

            <h2>Pride Events and How to Participate</h2>
            <p>Across the globe, various events such as parades, marches, parties, and educational sessions are organized. Participating in these events can be a meaningful way to support friends, family, and community members who are part of the LGBTQIA+ community.</p>
