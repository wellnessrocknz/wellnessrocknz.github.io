            <h1>Welcome to Pride Month Awareness</h1>
            <p>June is Pride Month, a time to celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community, reflect on the ongoing struggle for equal rights, and promote an inclusive society. This page is dedicated to increasing awareness and fostering an understanding of Pride Month.</p>
            
            <h2>Why is Pride Month Important?</h2>
            <p>Pride Month commemorates years of struggle for civil rights and the ongoing pursuit of equality for the LGBTQIA+ community. The celebrations and events during this month also serve as a reminder of the need for continued advocacy and support.</p>
            <p>Similarly, LGBTQIA+ stands for "lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex, asexual, and many other terms (such as non-binary and pansexual)."</p>

            <h2>Pride Events and How to Participate</h2>
            <p>Across the globe, various events such as parades, marches, parties, and educational sessions are organized. Participating in these events can be a meaningful way to support friends, family, and community members who are part of the LGBTQIA+ community.</p>
            
            <h2>Sweat with Pride</h2>
            <p>Sweat with Pride is an initiative that encourages individuals and communities to engage in physical activities and sports to raise funds for life-changing Rainbow and Takatāpui support services. It's a way to promote health, wellness, and solidarity while raising awareness about LGBTQIA+ issues.</p>
            <p>Here are some key points about Sweat with Pride:
                <ul>
                    <li>Work up a sweat every day this June to raise funds for life-changing support services for Rainbow Kiwis.</li>
                    <li>Schools, workplaces, and doctors’ offices are still not safe places for many of our communities, which puts lives at risk. More than half of our rainbow whānau have experienced mental illness, and one in five rainbow rangatahi have attempted suicide.</li>
                    <li>STIs like syphilis, mpox, and HIV are still far too common in our community.</li>
                    <li>Work up a sweat for at least 21 minutes every day in June and get your friends and family to sponsor you to fund life-changing support services for Rainbow Kiwis.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
